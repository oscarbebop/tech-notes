## About The Project

![tech notes](./static/github-promotional.jpg)

Tech Notes is an alternative to traditional documentation.

The idea behind this project is to provide a simple and quick reference to a programming language, framework or library.

This project is not intended to replace any documentation, but to be an alternative that helps developers to solve doubts with short examples and simple examples.

## Characteristics

### Dark Theme

![dark mode](./static/tech-notes-dark-mode.jpg)

Currently the project has a dark theme built in and can be easily changed with a toggle

### Support for multiple languages

**English and Spanish** for the moment. The idea behind the project is to make it accessible to as many people as possible. If you want to contribute by implementing a new language please check the contributions section at the bottom of this document

## Stack

Tech Notes is developed on a [MERN Stack](https://getbootstrap.com). These are the technologies that mainly compose it:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
